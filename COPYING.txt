Copying information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This project uses SPDX license list short identifiers <https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/using-SPDX-short-identifiers-in-source-files/> and SPDX file tags <https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/file-tags/> to declare its copying information.


Where to Find the Licenses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A copy of each license that this project uses can be found in the LICENSES/ folder. Each file is titled using an SPDX license-id or license-ref followed by “.txt” (see <https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/SPDX-license-expressions/#d1-overview>). For example, if this project had a file that was under the “BSD Zero Clause License” <https://spdx.org/licenses/0BSD.html>, the there would be a copy of that license at “LICENSES/0BSD.txt”. Another example: a file in this project contains “SPDX-License-Identifier” followed by “: LicenseRef-MIT-Godot”. That means that a copy of that file’s license can be found at “LICENSES/LicenseRef-MIT-Godot.txt”.

CC0-1.0 is used as a license for only one file (see “Note About Copying Information.txt”). It can be found at “LEGAL TOOLS/CC0-1.0.txt”.


.spdx-meta Files and their Partner Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sometimes, this project will include .spdx-meta Files. Every .spdx-meta File has a Partner File.

A .spdx-meta File is a file that is in the same directory as another file. The other file is its Partner File. The .spdx-meta File’s name is its Partner File’s name with “.spdx-meta” added to the end. For example:
	file.ext — a hypothetical Partner File
	file.ext.spdx-meta — that Partner File’s .spdx-meta File
Everything in a .spdx-meta File applies to its Partner File. For example, if file.ext.spdx-meta contains “SPDX-FileComment” followed by “: This file is the best!”, then that means that file.ext’s FileComment is “This file is the best!” It does not mean that file.ext.spdx-meta’s FileComment is “This file is the best!”

All .spdx-meta Files in this project were dedicated to the public domain using the CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication <https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>.
