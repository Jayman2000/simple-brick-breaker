## Hints for contributors

- Every file should declare its own copying information. See the comment at the
top of `COPYING.md` for an example.
- Use tabs for indentation. The only exception to this rule is in YAML files
because [YAML requires spaces for
indentation.](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#61-indentation-spaces) In YAML
files, use 4 spaces for indentation.
- The .pxo files are [Pixelorama](https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama)
projects.
- Before adding images to the project,
	I convert them into lossless WebPs using cwebp to make them smaller:

		cwebp input.png -o lossless output.webp

	Cwebp is from [libwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/).


## pre-commit

You can use [pre-commit] to automatically check your contributions.

1. Open a terminal.
2. Make sure that [pre-commit] is installed.
	1. Run `pre-commit --version`
	2. If it gives you an error, follow [these instructions](https://pre-commit.com/#installation).
3. `cd` to the root of this repo.
4. Install [pre-commit] as a [Git hook]. To do so, run
	```bash
	pre-commit install
	```

At this point, whenever you run `git commit`, [pre-commit] will run a series of
tests for the files that you modified.

There‚Äôs a few [pre-commit] hook failures that I‚Äôm OK with:

- Some [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files fail one
of pre-commit‚Äôs hooks, but only because one line is too long. I‚Äôm OK with that
line being too long.

When I run into an error that I‚Äôm OK with, I [skip the failing hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#temporarily-disabling-hooks)
for that commit.
